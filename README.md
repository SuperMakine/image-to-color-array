How to use (should work with .png, .jpeg and .gif files):
1. Have your "multiuse" python file in a good location where you also have the image/GIF you want to convert.
2. Open the py file.
3. it asks for your images'/GIF's name, ADD the .png/.jpeg/.gif ending.
4. It should create a "COPY.txt" file where the python file is located.
5. Open the "COPY.txt" file and "ctrl + a" & "ctrl + c" to copy everything from that file.
6. Open "workshop" in RYMFQ Overwatch 2 custom game and remove "GIF loop" and every "Frame" after it. FOR NORMAL IMAGES just remove "GIF loop" and every "Frame" and then paste in "Color array (normal images here)"
7. Still in the workshop you should see a orange paste icon at the top, use it. If everything went well it should have pasted multiple "rules". (FOR GIF)
8. Restart the match and use [interact] to create the display. (BOTH)
